Tea... Is it just a drink or is there something more behind it? From an early age tea was one of the main parts of daily life in different cultures and civilization.  
Tea connects people, calms the mind, brings harmony and balance.    
**Art of Tea** is a refuge for a soul in the bustle of the city, an island of calm in the very heart of Dublin!   
Tea ceremonies in our tea club proceed in the atmosphere of solitude and relaxation. This is an immersion into the secrets of the tea consuming traditions of the nations of the world, as well as a place for romantic dates and meetings with friends.

### Design
#### Framework
- [Bootstrap](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/), front-end framework is chosen for this project for its modern interface, ease of use and ability to be easily customized. It is used for creating features such as navbar, cards, forms, modals, as well as for the layout.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) is used for initializing some Bootstrap components, as well as for custom functions, DOM manipulation.
#### Colour Scheme
One of the main goals in UI was to focus user's attention on the products/services images. Therefore **calm** colors and **different shades** of one colour were mostly used accross the website's design.   
**Green** and **black** are the colours associated with tea world, help us to immerse users to the **tea world**. While bright **salmon** colour is used for some buttons, headings to create a contrast and catch user's attention.   
 Different shades of grey colour and shadows allow us to create clean and neat backgrounds and volume effect accross the website.   
 
![Color Palette](wireframes/colour-palette.png)
#### Typography
There are three fonts used across the project that I find a good combination: 
- [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) used as the main body font, popular modern sans-serif typeface providing good readability.
- [Marko One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Marko+One) - elegant, decorative and eye-catching font, used mostly for headings.  
- [Sawarabi Mincho](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sawarabi+Mincho) - clean and simple font, perfectly fit to the "Art of Tea" and "East culture" theme, used for navbar elements and some headings.
#### Icons
Icons are used widely, as they are good attention grabbers. They help users to find and scan content quickly and easily. Another advantage of using them is to help to break language barriers. They create more user-friendly experience for people with non-native English by giving the visual clue about the subject.   
- I used [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) as the main icon library across the project (e.g. for social media links, forms, cart, search and user icons in navigation and others).
- Apart from that, I used some icons, specific to the tea world and East topic, that were found in a free icon library [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/). 

### Wireframes
[Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) tool was used to create all wireframes for the project.   

Initial wireframes for desktop, tablet and mobile can be found [here](https://github.com/irinatu17/Art-of-Tea/tree/master/wireframes).


**Note:** The website was changed and evolved through the development process and several improvements were applied.
The wireframes served as guidelines but some details such as positioning, placement of 
 images, buttons and other refinements diverge from the original wireframes.    
 Apart from that, there are some features that were included into original wireframes(such as reviews, social account login, image galleries for services/products), 
 but were considered of secondary importance and were not implemented yet due to time constraints. This is reflected in Features left to implement section, and I intend to come back to them and implement them in future when I can dedicate more time to it.

## Features
Art of Tea website is composed by eight different applications: `landing`, `about`, `events`, `contact`, `products`(contains products and services), `cart`, `checkout`, `profiles`.
### Existing Features     
#### Navbar
The navbar is fixed at the top of the page all the time, this allows a user to easily navigate throughout the website.
 The **logo** is located in the top left corner on a desktop and in the center on the smaller devices. 
 It redirects the user to the home/landing page when clicked. On the smaller resolutions (tablet, mobile) 
 the navbar is collapsed into a burger icon. Menu links appear when the burger icon is clicked and collapse back, when clicked again.    
 
Navbar also contains a **search box**, where user can search for product and also cart icon. It's collapsed into a search icon on the mobile and tablet, and slides down when the icon is clicked.     
Also, navbar contains a **cart icon** alomg with a grand total displayed if there are items in the cart added. It changes the colour to yellow when there's something
in the cart to catch user's attention, and remains white(as other navbar elements) when the cart is empty. Clicking the cart icon will redirect user to the cart page.   

The difference in navbar for logged in, non-logged in users and admin:   
- For **non-logged in** users or guests navbar contains the following links: Login, Register.

## Information Architecture
### Database choice
During the development phase I worked with **sqlite3** database which is installed with Django.   
For deployment, a **PostgreSQL** database is provided by Heroku as an add-on.

### Data Modelling
#### User
The User model used in this project is provided by Django as a part of defaults "django.contrib.auth.models". More information about Djangoâ€™s authentication system can be found [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/auth/).
