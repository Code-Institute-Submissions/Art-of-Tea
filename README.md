## Information Architecture
### Database choice
During the development phase I worked with **sqlite3** database which is installed with Django.   
For deployment, a **PostgreSQL** database is provided by Heroku as an add-on.

### Data Modelling
#### User
The User model used in this project is provided by Django as a part of defaults "django.contrib.auth.models". More information about Djangoâ€™s authentication system can be found [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/auth/).
