Tea connects people, calms the mind, brings harmony and balance.    
**Art of Tea** is a refuge for a soul in the bustle of the city, an island of calm in the very heart of Dublin!   
Tea ceremonies in our tea club proceed in the atmosphere of solitude and relaxation. This is an immersion into the secrets of the tea consuming traditions of the nations of the world, as well as a place for romantic dates and meetings with friends.

### Design
#### Framework
- [Bootstrap](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/), front-end framework is chosen for this project for its modern interface, ease of use and ability to be easily customized. It is used for creating features such as navbar, cards, forms, modals, as well as for the layout.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) is used for initializing some Bootstrap components, as well as for custom functions, DOM manipulation.
#### Colour Scheme
One of the main goals in UI was to focus user's attention on the products/services images. Therefore **calm** colors and **different shades** of one colour were mostly used accross the website's design.   
**Green** and **black** are the colours associated with tea world, help us to immerse users to the **tea world**. While bright **salmon** colour is used for some buttons, headings to create a contrast and catch user's attention.   
 Different shades of grey colour and shadows allow us to create clean and neat backgrounds and volume effect accross the website.   
 
![Color Palette](wireframes/colour-palette.png)
#### Typography
There are three fonts used across the project that I find a good combination: 
- [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) used as the main body font, popular modern sans-serif typeface providing good readability.
- [Marko One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Marko+One) - elegant, decorative and eye-catching font, used mostly for headings.  
- [Sawarabi Mincho](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sawarabi+Mincho) - clean and simple font, perfectly fit to the "Art of Tea" and "East culture" theme, used for navbar elements and some headings.
#### Icons
Icons are used widely, as they are good attention grabbers. They help users to find and scan content quickly and easily. Another advantage of using them is to help to break language barriers. They create more user-friendly experience for people with non-native English by giving the visual clue about the subject.   
- I used [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) as the main icon library across the project (e.g. for social media links, forms, cart, search and user icons in navigation and others).
- Apart from that, I used some icons, specific to the tea world and East topic, that were found in a free icon library [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/). 

### Wireframes
[Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) tool was used to create all wireframes for the project.   

Initial wireframes for desktop, tablet and mobile can be found [here](https://github.com/irinatu17/Art-of-Tea/tree/master/wireframes).


**Note:** The website was changed and evolved through the development process and several improvements were applied.
The wireframes served as guidelines but some details such as positioning, placement of 
 images, buttons and other refinements diverge from the original wireframes.    
 Apart from that, there are some features that were included into original wireframes(such as reviews, social account login, image galleries for services/products), 
 but were considered of secondary importance and were not implemented yet due to time constraints. This is reflected in Features left to implement section, and I intend to come back to them and implement them in future when I can dedicate more time to it.

## Features
Art of Tea website is composed by eight different applications: `landing`, `about`, `events`, `contact`, `products`(contains products and services), `cart`, `checkout`, `profiles`.
### Existing Features     
#### Navbar
The navbar is fixed at the top of the page all the time, this allows a user to easily navigate throughout the website.
 The **logo** is located in the top left corner on a desktop and in the center on the smaller devices. 
 It redirects the user to the home/landing page when clicked. On the smaller resolutions (tablet, mobile) 
 the navbar is collapsed into a burger icon. Menu links appear when the burger icon is clicked and collapse back, when clicked again.    
 
Navbar also contains a **search box**, where user can search for product and also cart icon. It's collapsed into a search icon on the mobile and tablet, and slides down when the icon is clicked.     
Also, navbar contains a **cart icon** alomg with a grand total displayed if there are items in the cart added. It changes the colour to yellow when there's something
in the cart to catch user's attention, and remains white(as other navbar elements) when the cart is empty. Clicking the cart icon will redirect user to the cart page.

##### Logout
Hitting "logout" button renders logout page, asking to confirm if a user wants to logout. It will end their session and redirects to the homepage with a toast success message appeared .

### Features Left to Implement
There are some features that I considered were of secondary importance and I have not implemented them yet due to time constraints, but intend to do so in future when I will be able to dedicate more time to them. Most of these features are displayed in my [original wireframes](https://github.com/irinatu17/Art-of-Tea/tree/master/wireframes).
#### Star based  Rating and Reviews
Users would be able to create, edit and delete their reviews for products and services. Rating would be displayd as stars(0-5) in the pruduct details and service details pages. Also, in the landing page reviews section, the static reviews would be replaced with the real ones, displaying up to 5 random reviews from the database.
#### User avatart
This feature would allow users to assigne the standard randomly picked avatar or upload their own photos/avatart. Avatar would be displayed on the user Profile page and also near the reviews, if a user have some.
####  Social account login (Google and Facebook)
This feature allows users to login using social networks accounts, Google and Facebook, that would enhance user experience and make the login process easier.
#### Image galleries 
As can be viewed in the original wireframes, I initially planned to assigne up to 3 for products and 5 for services images. An attempt at this was made by creating **ImageGallery** Model in the Products app. However, this feature would require much more time to search for the sutable images, resize them and implement further functionality. So due to mentioned above time constraints the ImageGallery model was removed from the database,image and image_url fields were moved to the Product model. In the future, I would like to implement this feature and add more images to the products and services for enchancing User Experience.
#### 404 and 500 error pages
I would also like to implement custom 404 and 500 pages containing a paragraph about the error and a button "Back Home". This would improve and simplify the navigation back to the website in case the user is get lost and error occured.   


Other small features are also consider to be implemented in feature, such as **Back to Top button**, **Scroll down button** on the landing page, **Sorting products** by price/name.

## Information Architecture
### Database choice
During the development phase I worked with **sqlite3** database which is installed with Django.   
For deployment(production), a **PostgreSQL** database is provided by Heroku as an add-on.
- The **User model** used in this project is provided by Django as a part of defaults `django.contrib.auth.models`. More information about Djangoâ€™s authentication system can be found [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/auth/).

## Deployment
The Art of Tea project was developed using the [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) online IDE and
using Git & GitHub for version control. It is hosted on the [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) platform, with static files on WhiteNoise and user-uploaded images being hosted in AWS S3 Basket.
### Local Deployment
To be able to run this project, the following tools have to be installed:
- An IDE of your choice (I used [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) for creating this project)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) 
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)    

Apart from that, you also need to create accounts with the following services:
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ie)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) to setup the [S3 basket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html)
- [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/)

#### Directions
1. You can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting the following command into the terminal:   
`git clone https://github.com/irinatu17/Art-of-Tea`    
Alternatively, you can save a copy of this repository by clicking the green button **Clone or download** , then **Download Zip** button, and after extract the Zip file to your folder.      
In the terminal window of your local IDE change the directory (CD) to the correct file location (directory that you have just created).       

Note: You can read more information about the cloning process on the [GitHub Help page](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).   

2. Set up environment variables.     
Note, that this process will be different depending on IDE you use.   
In this it was done using the following way:      
    - Create `.env` file in the root directory.
    - Add `.env` to the `.gitignore` file in your project's root directory
    - In `.env` file set environment variables with the following syntax:     
    `import os`   
    `os.environ["DEVELOPMENT"] = "True"`    
    `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "<Your Secret key>"`    
    `os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "<Your Stripe Public key>"`    
    `os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = "<Your Stripe Secret key>"`    
    `os.environ["STRIPE_WH_SECRET"] = "<Your Stripe WH_Secret key>"`       
       
Read more about how to set up the Stripe keys in the [Stripe Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/keys)
    
3. Install all requirements from the **requirements.txt** file putting this command into your terminal:     
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`     
4. In the terminal in your IDE migrate the models to crete a database using the following commands:         
`python3 manage.py migrate`     
5. Load the data fixtures(**categories**, **products**, **itinerary**, **itinerary_items**) in that order into the database using the following command:    
`python3 manage.py loaddata <fixture_name>`        
6. Create a super user to have an access to the the admin panel(you need to follow the instructions then and insert username,email and password):    
`python3 manage.py createsuperuser`   
7. You will now be able to run the application using the following command:     
`python3 manage.py runserver`     
8. To access the admin panel, you can add the `/admin` path at the end of the url link and login using your superuser credentials.

### Heroku Deployment
*To start Heroku Deployment process, you need to clone the project as described in the [Local deployment](#local-deployment) section above.*     
To deploy the project to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) the following steps need to be completed:    
1. Create a **requirement.txt** file, which contains a list of the dependencies, using the following command in the terminal:    
`pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`    
2. Create a **Procfile**, in order to tell Heroku how to run the project, using the following command in the terminal:
`web: gunicorn art_of_tea.wsgi:application`    
3. `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` these files to GitHub repository.     
NOTE: these 1-3 steps already done in this project and included in the GitHub repository, but illistrated here as they are required for the successfull deployment to Heroku.   
4. On the [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) website you need to create a **new app**, assigne a name (must be unique),set a region to the closest to you(for my project I set Europe) and click **Create app**.   
5. Go to **Resources** tab in Heroku, then in the **Add-ons** search bar look for **Heorku Postgres**(you can type `postgres`), select **Hobby Dev â€” Free** and click **Provision** button to add it to your project.     
6. In Heroku **Settings** click on **Reveal Config Vars**.   
7. Set the following config variables there:     

| KEY            | VALUE         |
|----------------|---------------|
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `<your aws access key>`  |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `<your aws secret access key>`  |
| DATABASE_URL| `<your postgres database url>`  |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS | `<your email password(generated by Gmail)>` |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER| `<your email address>`  |
| SECRET_KEY | `<your secret key>`  |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY| `<your stripe public key>`  |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY| `<your stripe secret key>`  |
| STRIPE_WH_SECRET| `<your stripe wh key>`  |
| USE_AWS | `True`  |
