Tea... Is it just a drink or is there something more behind it? From an early age tea was one of the main parts of daily life in different cultures and civilizations.  
Tea connects people, calms the mind, brings harmony and balance.    
**Art of Tea** is a refuge for a soul in the bustle of the city, an island of calm in the very heart of Dublin!   
Tea ceremonies in our tea club proceed in the atmosphere of solitude and relaxation. This is an immersion into the secrets of the tea consuming traditions of the nations of the world, as well as a place for romantic dates and meetings with friends.

In **Art of Tea** you can visit one of our tea ceremonies, book an event for your company and buy nice fresh tea and teaware delivered straight to your doors!

Explore the misterious and amazing world of tea with us!

### Design
#### Framework
- [Bootstrap](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/), front-end framework is chosen for this project for its modern interface, ease of use and ability to be easily customized. It is used for creating features such as navbar, cards, forms, modals, as well as for the layout.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) is used for initializing some Bootstrap components, as well as for custom functions, DOM manipulation.
#### Colour Scheme
One of the main goals in UI was to focus user's attention on the products/services images. Therefore **calm** colors and **different shades** of one colour were mostly used accross the website's design.   
**Green** and **black** are the colours associated with tea world, help us to immerse users to the **tea world**. While bright **salmon** colour is used for some headings and icons to create a contrast and catch user's attention.   
 Different shades of grey colour and shadows allow us to create clean and neat backgrounds and volume effect accross the website.   
 
![Color Palette](wireframes/colour-palette.png)
#### Typography
There are three fonts used across the project that I find a good combination: 
- [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) used as the main body font, popular modern sans-serif typeface providing good readability.
- [Marko One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Marko+One) - elegant, decorative and eye-catching font, used mostly for headings.  
- [Sawarabi Mincho](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sawarabi+Mincho) - clean and simple font, perfectly fit to the "Art of Tea" and "East culture" theme, used for navbar elements and some headings.
#### Icons
Icons are used widely, as they are good attention grabbers. They help users to find and scan content quickly and easily. Another advantage of using them is to help to break language barriers. They create more user-friendly experience for people with non-native English by giving the visual clue about the subject.   
- I used [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) as the main icon library across the project (e.g. for social media links, forms, cart, search and user icons in navigation and others).
- Apart from that, I used some icons, specific to the tea world and East topic, that were found in a free icon library [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/). 

### Wireframes
[Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) tool was used to create all wireframes for the project.   

Original wireframes for desktop, tablet and mobile can be found [here](https://github.com/irinatu17/Art-of-Tea/tree/master/wireframes).


**Note:** The website was changed and evolved through the development process and several improvements were applied.
The wireframes served as guidelines but some details such as positioning, placement of 
 images, buttons and other refinements diverge from the original wireframes.    
 Apart from that, there are some features that were included into original wireframes (such as reviews, social account login, image galleries for services/products), 
 but were considered of secondary importance and were not implemented yet due to time constraints. This is reflected in [Features left to implement](#features-left-to-implement) section, and I intend to come back to them and implement them in future when I can dedicate more time to it.

## Features
Art of Tea website is composed by eight applications: `landing`, `about`, `events`, `contact`, `products`(contains products and services), `cart`, `checkout`, `profiles`.
### Existing Features     
#### Navbar
The navbar is fixed at the top of the page all the time, this allows a user to easily navigate throughout the website.
 The **logo** is located in the top left corner on a desktop and in the center on the smaller devices. 
 It redirects a user to the home/landing page when clicked. On smaller resolutions (tablet, mobile) 
 the navbar is collapsed into a burger icon. Menu links appear when the burger icon is clicked and collapse back, when clicked again.    
 
Navbar also contains a **search box**, where a user can search for product. It is collapsed into a search icon on the mobile and tablet, and slides down when the icon is clicked.     
Also, navbar contains a **cart icon** along with a grand total displayed if there are items in the cart added. It changes the colour to yellow when there's something
in the cart to catch user's attention, and remains white (as other navbar elements) when the cart is empty. Clicking the cart icon will redirect a user to the cart page.   

The difference in navbar for logged in, non-logged in users and admin:   
- For **non-logged in** users or guests navbar contains the following links: Login, Register.   
- For **logged in** users it contains the **"My Account"** nav-item which toggles down the following links that redirect user to the corresponding pages: My Profile, Order History, Logout.   
- For **admin** apart from all the links available for logged-in users mentioned above, there is also a link to the Admin Managment page, where admin can add new products and services. This is avaliable only for superusers. Defensive design with corresponding error messages is in place to protect this page from manual entering the url in the browser.
#### Footer
Footer consists of 2 parts: main footer section and additional footer section which is displayed only on the large screens.   

Main footer section is stuck to the bottom of the page and displayed across all the screens. It contains the social media icon-links which redirect a user to the corresponding page, opening in a new tab. As it is not the real company, the links (except GitHub) redirect a user only to social media main pages.   
The additional desktop only section contains 
- **logo**, that is clickable and redirects to the landing page and also a small paragraph about the company
- **quick links** to the main pages
- **contact information** that contains address, phone number and email

#### Landing (home) page
The landing page serves to attract new users to the business, to give a clear understanding about that and to attract users to use the website's functionality (book ceremony/buy products). It consists of 9 sections:
- **Hero image** section contains a full-screen image, main heading with a subheading and 2 buttons "Book tea ceremony" and "Buy tea or teaware" that redirect a user to the services and products pages, correspondingly. The purpose of this section is to attract new users, to make the first impression and to call to action.
- **Introduction about** section  contains an introduction about the company, what it does and what can be found on the website. It also contains an image and a "Learn more" button which redirects a user to the About page.
- **Quote**  section  contains heading and Osho's quote about process of drinking tea, that gives a user an impression and understanding of some principles and ideas of the "Art of Tea" tea-club.
- **Our benefits** section provides a user information about the advantages of the company with a purpose of convincing users to use the functionality of the website. It contains 5 small paragraphs that describe benifits, along with authentic icons to enhance User Experience. 
- **Tea Ceremony** section contains a paragraph about tea ceremonies offered to book on the website, along with a button "View our services" that leads to the Services page. There's also an image-carousel with 3 images representing tea ceremonies.
- **Tea and Teaware** section also displays an image-carousel (3 images) and a paragraph about the online tea shop products, along with a button "View our products" that redirects to the Products page. 
- **Events** section contains a paragraph about the events happening in the tea club with a link to the Events page.
- **Reviews** sections contains the customers' reviews carousel with the user's avatars, review and usernames. Note: this section is static at the moment, but there's an intent to make it dynamic and to showcase real reviews, what's documented in [Features left to implement](#features-left-to-implement) section(reviews).
- **Contact** section contains a question and a link to the Contact page, allowing a user to post a query/question there via the form.

#### About page
The page provides a user information about the main focus of the website, its purposes, ideas and principles.    

It contains 3 sections: **Who we are**, **Our principles** and **Our mission** followed by the images and an image-carousel in the last section.

Delete button toggles the Delete modal. It asks a superuser to confirm if the product is to be deleted. If so, upon clicking "Delete" button, the product will be removed from the database, page reloads and the toast-message will inform about the sucessfull deletion. There is also a button "Cancel" that closes the modal when it's clicked. These actions can be done only by superuser, attempts to access them by other users will end up with redirection to the landing page with toast error messages displayed.

There is also a button "Cancel" that closes the modal when it's clicked. These actions can be done only by a superuser, attempts to access them by other users will end up with redirection to the landing page with toast error messages displayed.

- Other features available only to the **admin** are the **Edit** and **Delete** (same as in the Services page) allowing admin to edit or delete services respectivelly.
- To **add service to cart** a user has to fill the form that contains 2 fields: number of participants and date-time.

- If a user already has a profile with the shipping information saved, the form will be populated with this information.
- The **validation** messages will be displayed on click **Next** buttons, so a user can move on the next tab only if the current form-section is filled with valid information.
- The **save info** checkbox allows the form information to be saved to the user's profile for the **logged in** users.

- There's also an optional **Comment** field for cases if a user has any additional comments to the order.
- A user is informed how much the card will be charged in the paragraph below the **Proceed to payment** button.
- Since the website is made for educational purposes only and the Stripe functionality is only for testing, only **4242 4242 4242 4242** card number will lead to the successfull payment.
- A webhook is used to make sure that the order is processed even in the cases when the payment process is interrupted (e.g. if a user accidentally closes the page or browser after clicking "Proceed to payment" button).
- Once the form is submitted and the payment is successfully proceeded, the **Checkout sucesss** page is loaded and a confirmation email is sent to the user's email. Also, a toast message appears to ensure the user that the order was processed successfully.

Profle feature is available only for **authenticated** users.
- Profile page contains **Personal info** section (username and email displayed). Also it contains 2 buttons **Change password** and **Manage emails** (changing the current or adding a new email) that take a user to the corresponding pages (that's a part of Django allauth functionality with a customized templates).

#### Admin product managment
Admin managment feature is available only for **authenticated superuser**.
Admin page allows an owner of the website to add new products/services by filling out one of the two forms - **Add New Product** and **Add New Service**. 
If the form is valid, the product/service is added to the database and the user is redirected to the new created product/service details page.
The defensive design is implemented to restrict other than admin users to manually enter the url to get access to the page. User will be redirected to the home page with the toast error messages appeared.

#### Django-allauth features
##### Sign Up
The sign up page allows a user to create a new account. The user is asked to fill the fields "email", "username", "password" and "password (again)". When adding a username, the code compares it against existing email to ensure that it is unique. If user's input does not meet requirements, flash messages will inform a user about the error. When the form is submitted, a **verification email** is sent to the user's email to verify the email and finish registration process.   
There is also a link to the login page for existing users at the bottom of the form.    
 Registration page is only available to anonymous users.
##### Login
The login page features the form with "username" and "password" fields, allowing registered users to log into their account. If the login was successfull, a user is redirected to the home page and the toast success message appears informing that the log in was successful. Otherwise, flash messages will be displayed about incorrect user's input.   
There is also a link to the sign up page for new users at the bottom of the form.
As well as that, there's a link to the **forgot password** functionality, using which a user can reset their password.
Login page is only available to anonymous users.
##### Forgot password
A user can reset their password to be able to login by entering the email. Then the link for reseting password will be sent to the email provided. The user can create a new password and then login with a new password.
##### Logout
Hitting "logout" button renders logout page, asking to confirm if a user wants to logout. It will end their session and redirects to the homepage with a toast success message appeared.

### Features Left to Implement
There are some features that I considered were of secondary importance and I have not implemented them yet due to time constraints, but intend to do so in future when I will be able to dedicate more time to them. Most of these features are displayed in my [original wireframes](https://github.com/irinatu17/Art-of-Tea/tree/master/wireframes).
#### Star based  Rating and Reviews
Users would be able to create, edit and delete their reviews for products and services. Rating would be displayd as stars(0-5) in the product details and service details pages. Also, in the landing page reviews section, the static reviews would be replaced with the real ones, displaying up to 5 random reviews from the database.
#### User avatar
This feature would allow users to assign the standard randomly picked avatar or upload their own photos/avatar. Avatar would be displayed on the user Profile page and also near the reviews, if a user have some.
####  Social account login (Google and Facebook)
This feature allows users to login using social networks accounts, Google and Facebook, that would enhance user experience and make the login process easier.
#### Image galleries 
As can be viewed in the original wireframes, I initially planned to assign up to 3 for products and 5 for service images. An attempt at this was made by creating **ImageGallery** Model in the Products app. However, this feature would require much more time to search for the suitable images, resize them and implement further functionality. So due to mentioned above time constraints the ImageGallery model was removed from the database, image and image_url fields were moved to the Product model. In the future, I would like to implement this feature and add more images to the products and services for enchancing User Experience.
#### 404 and 500 error pages
I would also like to implement custom 404 and 500 pages containing a paragraph about the error and a button "Back Home". This would improve and simplify the navigation back to the website in case the user is get lost and error occured.   


Other small features are also considered to be implemented in feature, such as **Back to Top button** or/and **Pagination** in products, **Scroll down button** on the landing page, **Sorting products** by price/name, **Discout system**.

## Information Architecture
### Database choice
During the development phase I worked with **sqlite3** database which is installed with Django.   
For deployment(production), a **PostgreSQL** database is provided by Heroku as an add-on.
- The **User model** used in this project is provided by Django as a part of defaults `django.contrib.auth.models`. More information about Djangoâ€™s authentication system can be found [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/auth/).

## Testing
### Manual Testing
Manual testing was conducted with each feature and user story on different screen resolutions, devices and in different browsers. Some results and the actions that took place during the manual testing phase are displayed below:
#### Navbar, Search and Footer
- All links in the navbar and the footer were tested to ensure that they are pointing to the correct destination.
- On the smaller devices the **search** button collapses the search input box and redirects to the products page with correct results displayed. I've tried to submit an empty search query, the error appeared informing that no search word was entered. Also, I've tried to enter key that doesn't exist in the database to check if I get the paragraph telling that no results were found for the entered query.
- The hover effect on the nav-items was checked as well as the active page was highlighted correctly depending on which page I am currently on.
- In footer all the social media links lead to the corresponding pages and open in the new tabs.
#### Landing page 
- The animation on scroll works as expected
- All the links lead to the correct pages
- All the image-carousels work properly
#### About page
- Information is displayed correctly, animation on scroll and image gallery work as expected
#### Events page 
- The data from the Events model is displayed correctly in the events table- Facebook link opens in the new tab leading to the main Facebook page (since there is no real page exists for the website)
#### Contact
- I've tried to submit the empty form, or enter incorrect email address (without @), that led to the corresponding validation messages displayed. 
- If the form was valid and "Send" button clicked, I was redirected to the "Thank you" page, informing that the message was sent. As well as that, being an admin of the website, I received the real message on my email, that was assigned in the environment variables.
- Map on the contact page displays the correct location, the Info Window shows the opening hours, when the red marker is clicked. Zoom buttons also work correctly.
#### Products and product details pages
- I tried to select the category, sorting results were displayed correctly, the number of the products found shown in parentheses. 
- Logged in as an admin I could see Edit/Delete buttons, while when I tried to manually enter the `/edit/` and `/delete/` urls I got the error message displayed as expected.
- Clicking the "View details" button or product image redirects to the products details page.
- Breadcrumbs navigation works correctly on both products and product detailes pages.
- On the product details page I tried to submit the form with negative number (or higher than 999), but got the validation error messages as expected.
- Clicking on the category leads to the Products page with the filtering by the selected category.
- If the quantity form is submitted correctly, I can see the grand total in the navbar reflects this addition. Toast success message is displayed as expected.
#### Services and service details pages
- Edit/delete buttons on both pages are visible only for the admin of the store
- Clicking "Learn more" button redirects me to the service details page
- Contact us button redirects to the contact page
- I tried to submit empty form, leave the datetime field blank, put the incorrect number or datetime manually, after all these actions the validation errors were displayed not allowing me to submit the form with incorrect data.
- If the quantity form is submitted correctly, I can see the grand total in the navbar reflects this addition. Toast success message is displayed as expected.
- Bredcrumbs navigation works correctly on both services and service detailes pages.
- I added some itinerary items, page reloaded and I could see new itinerary item added and displayed. As well as that, I could remove the itinerary item by clicking the trash icon, toggling the delete modal and confirming the deletion. I tested this functionality from different accounts to make sure that only authenticated admin has an access to that.
#### Cart page
- All the items added to the cart are displayed correctly.
- Clicking "Continue shopping" leads to the products page.
- I tested update/remove functionality with different products and services to make sure that everything works as expected. Clicking remove button toggles the remove modal asking to confirm the action. Update functionality works well for both products and services, subtotal changes correspondingly to reflect the update.
- Clicking "Checkout" button redirects to the Checkout page.
- Toast messages are displayed as expected after update/remove actions.
#### Checkout and checkout success pages
- Order summary displays the order correctly, clicking "Edit cart" redirects back to the cart.
-I tried to submit an empty form or filled out incorrectly. The validation error messages were displayed correctly, not allowing to go to the next step before the current section is filled up with correct information.
- I created a large number of orders as logged in or non-logged in user, ticking or not the save-info checkbox. There was an issue with save-info field, that is described in the Bugs section and was successfully fixed.
- Also, I checked if the webhooks work as expected by temporary commenting out the part of `stripe.js` code that's responsible for submission and also by closing the page straight after clicking the "Proceed to payment" button. After that I checked the Stripe Dashboard to make sure that the order was created via webhooks and was saved to the database.
- 4242 4242 4242 4242 card number leads to the successfull payment.
- During testing of this feature I was always checking the Stripe dashboard to see if the charge was successfull.
- I tried to put the incorrect or incomplete card details to make sure that the error messages are displayed correctly.
- After the valid form was submitted, I received the confirmation email with all the correct order info. As well as that, the checkout page renders showing the order summary.
- When the order was completed by the logged-in user in the checkout success page, the "View full order history" button led to the Order history page.
#### Profile and Order History
- These features were tested to check if they are available only to the logged-in users.
- Clicking on the Order number on the order history page opens the past confirmation (checkout success) page with the corresponding toast info message.
- Profile page displayes all the personal info (email and username), clicking on the "Change password" and "Manage emails" buttons leads to the correct destinations.
- If all the shipping information on the profile page was deleted, then on the checkout page all the fields were empty. At the same time when I saved some shipping details on the profile page, the checkout form fields were prefilled, confirming that the shipping info was saved into the Profile model.
#### Admin product management functionality
- Add product/service forms work as expected: validation error messages in place, after successfull addition it redirects to the new created product/service page.
- I added few products/services without the image to test the no-image assignment.
- In production all images are stored in the AWS S3, so the Basket was constantly checked to make sure it works as expected.
- Edit/Delete functionality was tested many times, all the changes straight away can be seen in the database.
- The defensive design worked well allowing only superuser to have an access to this functionality.
#### Login/sign up/logout/forgot password
These features are built-in components of Django allauth package were tested manually as well, as about 5-10 different accounts were created.     
Forgot password, verification email, login - all work as expected.
- Entering incorrect emails, incorrect password and case sensitivity works as expected.
- Trying to register with an already registered email works as expected.
- Entering two different passwords and trying to enter old password when re-setting password works as expected.
- Registration and login pages are only available to anonymous users.

### Validators
#### HTML
All the HTML files were tested through [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input). Since it does not recognize Jinja2 templating language, it showed a number of errors. Apart from that, no other errors were found across the html pages.   
#### CSS
CSS files were tested through [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). Since it does not recognize CSS variables (I use :root{} for colours and fonts variables), there were several Parse Errors found.
As well as that, there are a few error warnings for some -webkit, -moz pseudo element selectors. Both errors can be safely ignored as they are not errors in fact. The rest of the CSS files was completely valid.   
#### JavaScript
JS file was tested through [Esprima](https://esprima.org/demo/validate.html) and [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) validators, code was syntactically valid. "$" was not defined by JSHint (it is necessary for jQuery Materialize initializing).    
#### Python
All python files were tested through [PEP8 Online](http://pep8online.com/) validator and further changes were made to make the code PEP8 compliant.

### Compatibility and Responsiveness
This website had been being tested during the development across **multiple browsers** (Chrome, Safary, Opera, FireFox, Internet Explorer) and on **multiple devices**: mobile (iPhone 5, 6, 8, Samsung Galaxy, Sony Xperia), tablets(iPad, iPadPro) and laptops (with HiDPI and MDPI and touch screens).              
Also, the following tools were used to constantly test the project:
- **Google Chrome's developer tools** to see how it looks across all the different device screen sizes to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.       
-  [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) and [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/) online tools for checking responsiveness on different devices.
Plenty of changes were made and necessary media queries added to make the website is fully responsive.        
The website renders poorly on Internet Explorer browser (as it is outdated). However, the website renders well as expected on all the other browsers.

### Other Testing 
- [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) was used throughout the unit testing of this project to provide continuous integration with the deployed site when pushing code to GitHub. It is configured via the `.travis.yml` file. All information about how to set it up can be found in [Travis Documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/).
- The app was constantly testing with **debugger** locally: `debug=True` throughout all the development process. Every time when there was an error (when app crashed), the debugger displayed an error message to the view, that allowed me to find the location of the error and fix it.
- I also asked my friends, family members and fellow students in Slack to thoroughly test my website in different devices, try to break it and to give me a feedback about the design, functionality and their user experience. Some further improvement took placed to enhance UX after this testing phase.

### Bugs
#### Save info
During the testing phase in production there was found an issue with save_info checbox: despite not being ticked(meaning that a user does not want to save the shipping information to the profile), it always saved that information. As the first two steps of the Checkout form are handling via JavaScript, its "true" and "false" values were not recognisable by Python(were not equal to True and False).     
To fix that few additional line od code was added to 
-  **stripe.js** file:    
`var saveInfo = document.getElementById('save_info').value;`
- **webhook_handler.py** file:     
`save_info = intent.metadata.save_info if hasattr(intent.metadata, 'save_info') else None`  

- **checkout/views.py** file:
```bash 
if request.POST['save_info'] == "true":
                request.session['save_info'] = True
            else:
                request.session['save_info'] = False
```

## Deployment
The Art of Tea project was developed using the [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) online IDE and
using Git & GitHub for version control. It is hosted on the [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) platform, with static files on WhiteNoise and user-uploaded images being hosted in AWS S3 Basket.
### Local Deployment
To be able to run this project, the following tools have to be installed:
- An IDE of your choice (I used [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) for creating this project)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) 
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)    

Apart from that, you also need to create accounts with the following services:
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ie)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) to setup the [S3 basket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html)
- [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/)

#### Directions
1. You can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting the following command into the terminal:   
`git clone https://github.com/irinatu17/Art-of-Tea`    
Alternatively, you can save a copy of this repository by clicking the green button **Clone or download** , then **Download Zip** button, and after extract the Zip file to your folder.      
In the terminal window of your local IDE change the directory (CD) to the correct file location (directory that you have just created).       

Note: You can read more information about the cloning process on the [GitHub Help page](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).   

2. Set up environment variables.     
Note, that this process will be different depending on IDE you use.   
In this it was done using the following way:      
    - Create `.env` file in the root directory.
    - Add `.env` to the `.gitignore` file in your project's root directory
    - In `.env` file set environment variables with the following syntax:     
    ```bash 
    import os  
    os.environ["DEVELOPMENT"] = "True"    
    os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "<Your Secret key>"    
    os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "<Your Stripe Public key>"    
    os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = "<Your Stripe Secret key>"    
    os.environ["STRIPE_WH_SECRET"] = "<Your Stripe WH_Secret key>"    
     ```
       
Read more about how to set up the Stripe keys in the [Stripe Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/keys)
    
3. Install all requirements from the **requirements.txt** file putting this command into your terminal:     
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`     
4. In the terminal in your IDE migrate the models to crete a database using the following commands:    
`python3 manage.py makemigrations`     
`python3 manage.py migrate`     
5. Load the data fixtures(**categories**, **products**, **itinerary**, **itinerary_items**) in that order into the database using the following command:    
`python3 manage.py loaddata <fixture_name>`        
6. Create a superuser to have an access to the the admin panel(you need to follow the instructions then and insert username,email and password):    
`python3 manage.py createsuperuser`   
7. You will now be able to run the application using the following command:     
`python3 manage.py runserver`     
8. To access the admin panel, you can add the `/admin` path at the end of the url link and login using your superuser credentials.

### Heroku Deployment
*To start Heroku Deployment process, you need to clone the project as described in the [Local deployment](#local-deployment) section above.*     
To deploy the project to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) the following steps need to be completed:    
1. Create a **requirement.txt** file, which contains a list of the dependencies, using the following command in the terminal:    
`pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`    
2. Create a **Procfile**, in order to tell Heroku how to run the project, using the following command in the terminal:      
`web: gunicorn art_of_tea.wsgi:application`    
3. `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` these files to GitHub repository.     
NOTE: these 1-3 steps already done in this project and included in the GitHub repository, but illistrated here as they are required for the successfull deployment to Heroku.        
As well as that, other things that are required for the Heroku deployment and have to be installed: **gunicorn** (WSGI HTTP Server), **dj-database-url** for database connection and **Psycopg** (PostgreSQL driver for Python). All of the mentioned above are *already installed* in this project in the requirements.txt file.     
4. On the [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) website you need to create a **new app**, assigne a name (must be unique),set a region to the closest to you(for my project I set Europe) and click **Create app**.   
5. Go to **Resources** tab in Heroku, then in the **Add-ons** search bar look for **Heorku Postgres**(you can type `postgres`), select **Hobby Dev â€” Free** and click **Provision** button to add it to your project.     
6. In Heroku **Settings** click on **Reveal Config Vars**.   
7. Set the following config variables there:     

| KEY            | VALUE         |
|----------------|---------------|
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `<your aws access key>`  |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `<your aws secret access key>`  |
| DATABASE_URL| `<your postgres database url>`  |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS | `<your email password(generated by Gmail)>` |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER| `<your email address>`  |
| SECRET_KEY | `<your secret key>`  |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY| `<your stripe public key>`  |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY| `<your stripe secret key>`  |
| STRIPE_WH_SECRET| `<your stripe wh key>`  |
| USE_AWS | `True`  |

8. Copy **DATABASE_URL's value**(Postrgres database URL) from the Convig Vars and temporary paste it into the default database in **settings.py**.     
You can temporary comment out the current database settings code and just paste the following in the settings.py:   
```bash 
  DATABASES = {     
        'default': dj_database_url.parse("<your Postrgres database URL here>")     
    }
  ```
Note: that's just temporary set up, this URL **should not be committed and published to GitHub** for security reasons, so make sure not to commit your changes to Git while the URL is in the settings.py.     
9. Migrate the database models to the Postgres database using the following commands in the terminal:    
`python3 manage.py makemigrations`     
`python3 manage.py migrate`     
10. Load the data fixtures(**categories**, **products**, **itinerary**, **itinerary_items**) into the  Postgres database using the following command:     
`python3 manage.py loaddata <fixture_name>`      
11. Create a **superuser** for the Postgres database by running the following command(*you need to follow the instructions and inserting username,email and password*):      
`python3 manage.py createsuperuser`     
12. You need to remove your Postgres URL database from the settings and uncomment the default DATABASE settings code in the settings.py file.    
Note: for production you get the environment variable 'DATABASE_URL' from the Heroku Config Vars and use Postgress database, while for development you use the SQLite as a default database.     
13. Add your Heroku app URL to **ALLOWED_HOSTS** in the settings.py file.
14. You can connect Heroku to GitHub to automatically deploy each time you push to GitHub.    
To do so, from the Heroku dashboard follow the steps:
-  **Deploy** section -> **Deployment method** -> select **GitHub**
-  link the Heroku app to your GitHub repository for this project
- click **Enable Automatic Deploys** in the Automatic Deployment section
- Run `git push` command in the terminal, that would now push your code to both Github and Heroku, and perform the deployment.     

Alternatively, in the terminal you can run:    
- `heroku login`    
-  after adding and comitting to Git, run the following command:     
`git push heroku master`
15. After successful deployment, you can view your app bu clicking **Open App** on Heroku platform.
16. You will also need to verify your email address, so you need to login with your superuser credentials and verify your email address in the admin panel. Now you will be able to view the app running!    
##### Hosting media files with AWS
The **static files** for this project are hosted in [WhiteNoise](http://whitenoise.evans.io/en/stable/)(all the settings are in place and will be installed with requirements.txt, you don't need to do anything). The **media files** that will be uploaded by users(product/service images upliaded by superuser) are hosted in the [AWS S3 Bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/). To do so, you need to create an account in AWS and create your S3 basket with *public access*. More about setting it up you can read in [Amazon S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) and [this tutorial](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html).
##### Senging email via Gmail
In order to send real emails from the application, you need to connect it to your **Gmail account**, setting up your **email address** in EMAIL_HOST_USER variable and your **app password** generated by your email provider in EMAIL_HOST_PASS variable.

##### Google Maps API key set up
- In the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/) create a new project.
- Click **Continue** to enable the API and any related services.
- Get an **API key** and set the API key restrictions on the **Credentials** page. You can read more about [Using API Keys documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys).
- In the **scripts.html** file (templates/includes/scripts.html) replace the value of the key parameter in the URL with **your own API key**.
  ```bash 
  <script async defer
    src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE&callback=initMap">
  </script>
  ```
