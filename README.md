Tea... Is it just a drink or is there something more behind it? From an early age tea was one of the main parts of daily life in different cultures and civilization.  
Tea connects people, calms the mind, brings harmony and balance.    
**Art of Tea** is a refuge for a soul in the bustle of the city, an island of calm in the very heart of Dublin!   
Tea ceremonies in our tea club proceed in the atmosphere of solitude and relaxation. This is an immersion into the secrets of the tea consuming traditions of the nations of the world, as well as a place for romantic dates and meetings with friends.

In **Art of Tea** you can visit one of our tea ceremonies, book an event for your company and buy nice fresh tea and teaware delivered straight to your doors!

Explore the misterious and amazing world of tea with us!

### Design
#### Framework
- [Bootstrap](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/), front-end framework is chosen for this project for its modern interface, ease of use and ability to be easily customized. It is used for creating features such as navbar, cards, forms, modals, as well as for the layout.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) is used for initializing some Bootstrap components, as well as for custom functions, DOM manipulation.
#### Colour Scheme
One of the main goals in UI was to focus user's attention on the products/services images. Therefore **calm** colors and **different shades** of one colour were mostly used accross the website's design.   
**Green** and **black** are the colours associated with tea world, help us to immerse users to the **tea world**. While bright **salmon** colour is used for some buttons, headings to create a contrast and catch user's attention.   
 Different shades of grey colour and shadows allow us to create clean and neat backgrounds and volume effect accross the website.   
 
![Color Palette](wireframes/colour-palette.png)
#### Typography
There are three fonts used across the project that I find a good combination: 
- [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) used as the main body font, popular modern sans-serif typeface providing good readability.
- [Marko One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Marko+One) - elegant, decorative and eye-catching font, used mostly for headings.  
- [Sawarabi Mincho](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sawarabi+Mincho) - clean and simple font, perfectly fit to the "Art of Tea" and "East culture" theme, used for navbar elements and some headings.
#### Icons
Icons are used widely, as they are good attention grabbers. They help users to find and scan content quickly and easily. Another advantage of using them is to help to break language barriers. They create more user-friendly experience for people with non-native English by giving the visual clue about the subject.   
- I used [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) as the main icon library across the project (e.g. for social media links, forms, cart, search and user icons in navigation and others).
- Apart from that, I used some icons, specific to the tea world and East topic, that were found in a free icon library [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/). 

### Wireframes
[Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) tool was used to create all wireframes for the project.   

Initial wireframes for desktop, tablet and mobile can be found [here](https://github.com/irinatu17/Art-of-Tea/tree/master/wireframes).


**Note:** The website was changed and evolved through the development process and several improvements were applied.
The wireframes served as guidelines but some details such as positioning, placement of 
 images, buttons and other refinements diverge from the original wireframes.    
 Apart from that, there are some features that were included into original wireframes(such as reviews, social account login, image galleries for services/products), 
 but were considered of secondary importance and were not implemented yet due to time constraints. This is reflected in Features left to implement section, and I intend to come back to them and implement them in future when I can dedicate more time to it.

## Features
Art of Tea website is composed by eight different applications: `landing`, `about`, `products`, `events`, `contact`, `cart`, `checkout` and `profiles`.
### Existing Features     
#### Navbar
The navbar is fixed at the top of the page all the time, this allows a user to easily navigate throughout the website.
 The logo is located in the top left corner on a desktop and in the center on the smaller devices. 
 It redirects the user to the home/landing page when clicked. On the smaller resolutions (tablet, mobile) 
 the navbar is collapsed into a burger icon. Menu links appear when the burger icon is clicked and collapse back, when clicked again.    
 
Navbar also contains a search box, where user can search for product and also cart icon. It's collapsed into a search icon on the mobile and tablet, and slides down when the icon is clicked.     
Also, navbar contains a cart icon alomg with a grand total displayed if there are items in the cart added. It changes the colour to yellow when there's something
in the cart to catch user's attention, and remains white(as other navbar elements) when the cart is empty. Clicking the cart icon will redirect user to the cart page.   

The difference in navbar for logged in, non-logged in users and admin:   
- For **non-logged in** users or guests navbar contains the following links: Login, Register.   
- For **logged in** users it contains the "My Account" nav-item which toggles down the following links that redirect user to the corresponding pages: My Profile, Order History, Logout.   
- For **admin** apart from all the links available for logged-in users mentioned above, there is also link to Admin Managment, where admin can add new products and services. That's avaliable only for superusers and defensive-design with corresponding error-messages is in place to protect this from manual entering the url in the browser.
#### Footer
Footer consists of 2 parts: main footer section and additional footer section which is displayed only on the large screens.   

Main footer section is stick to the bottom of the page and displayed across all the screens. It contains the social media icons-links which redirect a user to the corresponding page, opening in a new tab. As it is not the real company, the links redirect a user only to social media main pages.   
The additional desktop only section contains 
- logo, that is clickable and redirect to the landing page and also small paragraph about the company
- quick links to the main pages
- contact informations that contains address, phone number and email

#### Landing(home) page
The landing page serves to attract new users to the business, to give a clear understanding about that and to attract users to use the website's functionality(book ceremony/buy products). It contains of 9 sections:
- **Hero image** section contains a full-screen image, main heading with a subheading and 2 buttons "Book tea ceremony" and "Buy tea or teaware" that redirect a user to the services and products pages correspondingly. The purpose of this section is to interest new user,to make the first impression and to call to action.
- **Introduction about** section  contains an introduction about the company, what it does and what can be find on the website. It also contain an image and "Learn more" button which redirects a user to the About page.
- **Quote**  section  contains heading and Osho's quote about process of drinking tea, that gives a user an impression and understanding of the some principles and ideas in the "Art of Tea" tea-club.
- **Our benefits** - this section provides a user information about the advantages of the company with a purpose of convincing users to use the functionality of the website. It contains 5 small benefits-paragraphs, along with authentic icons to enhance User Experience. 
- **Tea Ceremony** section contains a paragraph about tea ceremonies offered to book in the website, along with a button "View our services" that leads to the Services page. There's also an image-carousel with 3 images representing tea ceremonies.
- **Tea and Teaware** section also displays an image-carousel (3 images) and a paragraph about the online tea-shop products, along with a button "View our products" that redirects to the Products page. 
- **Events** section contains a paragraph about the events in happening in the tea club with a link to the Events page.
- **Reviews** sections contains the customer's reviews carousel with the user's avatars, review and usernames. Note: this section is static at the moment, but there's an intent to make it dynamic and to showcase real reviews, what's documented in Features left to implement section(reviews).
- **Contact** section contains a question and a link to the Contact page, allowing a user to post a query/question there via the form.
#### Contact

#### Create account
The register page allows a user to create a new account. The user is asked to fill the fields "username", "password" and "confirm password". When adding a username, the code compares it against existing usernames to ensure that it is unique. The requirements to username and password are displayed as well. If user's input does not meet requirements, flash messages will inform a user about the error. When the form is submitted successfully, a user is redirected to the home page and informed that account was created. There is also a link to the login page for existing users at the bottom of the form.
#### Login
The login page features the form with "username" and "password" fields, allowing registered users to log into their account. If the entered username and hashed password match the ones in the database, a user is redirected to the home page and informed that the log in was successful. Otherwise, flash messages will be displayed about incorrect user's input. There is also a link to the register page for new users at the bottom of the form.
#### Google and facebook login
Allows users to login using social networks accounts.

Hitting "logout" button by the logged in users ends their session and redirects to the homepage.
