# Art of Tea

Tea... Is it  just a drink or is there something more behind it? From an early age tea was one of the main parts of daily life in different cultures and civilization.  
TEA connects people, calms the mind, brings harmony and balance.    
"Art of Tea" is a refuge for a soul in the bustle of the city, an island of calm in the very heart of Dublin!   
Tea ceremonies in our tea club proceed in the atmosphere of solitude and relaxation. This is an immersion into the secrets of the tea consuming traditions of the nations of the world, as well as a place for romantic dates and meetings with friends.

In "Art of Tea" you can visit one of our tea ceremonies, book an event for your company and buy nice fresh tea and teaware delivered straight to your doors!

Explore the misterious and amazing world of tea with us!

### Design
#### Framework
- [Bootstrap](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/), front-end framework is chosen for this project for its modern interface, ease of use and ability to be easily customized. It is used for creating features such as navbar, cards, forms, modals, as well as for its layout.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) is used for initializing some Bootstrap, as well as for custom functions, DOM manipulation.
#### Colour Scheme
One of the main goals in UI was to focus user's attention on the products/services images. Therefore **calm** colors and **different shades** of one colour were mostly used accross the website's design.   
 Green, brown and black are the colours associated with tea help us to immerse users to the **tea world**. While different shades of grey colour allow us to create clean and neat backgrounds and volume effect accross the website.   
 
![Color Palette](wireframes/palette.png)
#### Typography
There are three fonts used across the project that I find a good combination: 
- [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) used as the main body font, popular modern sans-serif typeface providing good readability.
- [Marko One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Marko+One) - elegant, decarative and eye-catching font, used mostly for headings.  
- [Sawarabi Mincho](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sawarabi+Mincho) - clean and simple font, perfectly fit to the "Art of Tea" and "East culture" theme.
#### Icons
Icons are used widely, as they are good attention grabbers. They help users to find and scan content quickly and easily. Another advantage of using them is to help to break language barriers. They create more user-friendly experience for people with non-native English by giving the visual clue about the subject.   
- I used [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) as the main icon library across the project (e.g. for social media links, forms, cart, search and user icons in navigation and others).
- Apart from that, I used some icons, specific to the tea world and East topic that were found in a free icons library [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/). 
#### Further styling decisions
*will be added during development phase*
### Wireframes
[Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) tool was used to create all wireframes for the project.   

Initial wireframes for desktop, tablet and mobile can be found [here](https://github.com/irinatu17/Art-of-Tea/tree/master/wireframes).

During the development phase I worked with **sqlite3** database which is installed with Django.   
For deployment, a **PostgreSQL** database is provided by Heroku as an add-on.

### Data Modelling
#### User
The User model used in this project is provided by Django as a part of defaults "django.contrib.auth.models". More information about Djangoâ€™s authentication system can be found [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/auth/).
